# Project name : CPP Module 01

This module of 42 school's C++ piscine explores issues of class inheritance.

## Ex00 - ClapTrap
In the first exercise, we must implement a simple class, ClapTrap, which has the ability to attack, take damage and be repaired. The class also has private attributes: a name, hit points, energy points and attack damage.

### Usage

In order to compile : `make`

Execution :

```
./ClapTrap
```
The output shows the results of a functionality test.

## Ex01 - ScavTrap
The second exercise builds on the first by implementing another class, ScavTrap, which inherits from the previously created ClapTrap class and implements some new functionality, guardGate. ScavTrap also has different default values in its hit points, energy points and attack damage attributes.

### Usage

In order to compile : `make`

Execution :

```
./ScavTrap
```

## Ex02 - FragTrap
The third exercise introduces yet another class, FragTrap, which also inherits from the ClapTrap class and also has its own functionality, highFivesGuys. FragTrap also has different default values in its hit points, energy points and attack damage attributes compared to both ClapTrap and ScavTrap.

### Usage

In order to compile : `make`

Execution :

```
./FragTrap
```
