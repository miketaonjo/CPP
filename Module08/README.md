# Project name : CPP Module 08

This module of 42 school's C++ piscine explores templated containers, iterators, and algorithms. The use of STL and related algorithms is highly encouraged in this module.

## Ex00 - Easyfind
In the first exercise, we must create a simple template function, easyfind, which finds the first occurence of an integer in a container, whether it be a vector, a deque, a list...

### Usage

In order to compile : `make`

Execution :

```
./ex00
```
The output shows the results of functionality tests.

## Ex01 - Span
In the second exercise, we must implement a Span class that can store integers. Using iterators and algorithm functions, it must be able to add a number or a range of numbers to its container. It must also be able to calculate the shortest and the longest span within the numbers it stores.

### Usage

In order to compile : `make`

Execution :

```
./ex01
```

## Ex02 - MutantStack
The third exercise requires us to create a new container called MutantStack, which adds iterator functionality to the standard `std::stack` container.

### Usage

In order to compile : `make`

Execution :

```
./ex02
```
